       Rambo: Last Blood[a] is a 2019 American action film directed by Adrian Grünberg. The screenplay, co-written by Matthew Cirulnick and Sylvester Stallone (from a story by Dan Gordon and Stallone), is based on the character John Rambo created by author David Morrell for his novel First Blood. A sequel to Rambo (2008), it is the fifth installment in the Rambo franchise and co-stars Paz Vega, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Adriana Barraza, Yvette Monreal, Genie Kim, Joaquín Cosío, and Oscar Jaenada. In the film, Rambo (reprised by Stallone) travels to Mexico to save his adopted niece, who has been kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and forced into prostitution.
