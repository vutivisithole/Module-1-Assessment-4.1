            F9 (also known as F9: The Fast Saga and Fast & Furious 9) is a 2021 American action film directed by Justin Lin from a screenplay by Daniel Casey and Lin.[9] It is the sequel to The Fate of the Furious (2017), the ninth main installment, and the tenth full-length film in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Michael Rooker, Helen Mirren, Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron. In F9, Dominic Toretto and the team come together to stop a world-shattering plot headed by Toretto's brother, Jakob.</p>

<p>With a ninth and tenth film planned since 2014, Lin was confirmed to be directing F9 in October 2017, returning to the franchise since last directing Fast & Furious 6 (2013). F9 is the first film in the franchise since 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) not written by Chris Morgan. The cast was finalized with the addition of Cena in June 2019 and principal photography began that same month and lasted until that November, with filming locations including London, Los Angeles, Tbilisi, and Thailand.</p>

        <p>F9 was originally scheduled for worldwide release by Universal Pictures in April 2020, but was delayed several times, first due to the release of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) and planned release of No Time to Die (2021), and then the COVID-19 pandemic. It premiered in South Korea and was released internationally on May 19, 2021, and in the United States on June 25. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the stunts and Lin's direction, but criticism for its unrealistic action sequences and formulaic script. It has grossed over $592 million worldwide as of July 2021, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2021.</p>
