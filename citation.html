   <p>The new Netflix drama-thriller Citation tells the story of an ambitious college student who decides to speak up and report the professor who sexually assaulted her. 

The movie sheds new light on the detrimental impacts of the common tendency of victim-blaming, contrasting the two radically different realities recounted by the established academic and his 21-year-old mentee. So, is Citation based on a true story?

Directed by Kunle Afolayan and written by Tunde Babalola, Citation aims to contrast the stories told by Moremi Oluwa (Temi Otedola) and Prof. Lucien N'Dyare (Jimmy Jean-Louis). The former claims that the professor attempted to rape her, while the latter presents a chillingly convincing argument holding that his student initiated the relationship. According to IMDb, the movie is based on real events. 

Moremi's allegations have a seismic impact on the whole campus, leading a group of students to launch a campaign encouraging women who were subjected to sexual harassment to speak up. </p>
